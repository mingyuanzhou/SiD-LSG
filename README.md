# Text-to-Image Diffusion Distillation with SiD-LSG

This **SiD-LSG** repository contains the code and model checkpoints necessary to replicate the findings of our ICLR 2025 paper: [Guided Score identity Distillation for Data-Free One-Step Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01561). Note that this paper was originally titled **"Long and Short Guidance in Score Identity Distillation for One-Step Text-to-Image Generation"** and was first posted on arXiv in June 2024, alongside the release of the corresponding code and model checkpoints. The technique, Long and Short Guidance (**LSG**), is used with Score identity Distillation (**SiD**: [ICML 2024 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04057), [Code](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD)) to distill Stable Diffusion models for one-step text-to-image generation in a data-free manner.

We are actively developing an improved version of **SiD-LSG**, which will be placed in a separate branch and introduce the following enhancements:  

1. **AMP Support** – Leverages automatic mixed precision (AMP) to significantly reduce memory usage and improve speed compared to the current FP32 default, with minimal impact on performance.
2. **FSDP + AMP Integration** – Supports much larger models by combining Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) with AMP. Our implementation relies solely on native PyTorch libraries, avoiding third-party containers to ensure maximum flexibility for code customization.  
3. **Diffusion GAN Integration** – Building on the success of SiDA ([ICLR 2025 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14919), [Code](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD/tree/sida)), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling EDM and EDM2 models using a single generation step and without requiring CFG, we will integrate adversarial training from diffusion GANs ([ICLR 2023 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02262), [Code](https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Diffusion-GAN)) into guided SiD. This enhancement will significantly improve the trade-off between reducing FID (better diversity) and increasing CLIP scores (better text-image alignment), all without introducing any additional model parameters.
4. **A New Guidance Strategy** – Introduces a novel guidance method with lower memory and computational requirements than LSG, while achieving comparable performance without the need for tuning the guidance scale.
5. **Multistep Distillation** – Enhances performance by enabling the distillation of multi-step generators. Note this was already implemented in the current code, but some adjustments are needed to unlock its potential.

## State-of-the-art Performance
SiD-LSG functions as a data-free distillation method capable of generating photo-realistic images in a single step. By employing a relatively low guidance scale, such as 1.5, it surpasses the teacher stable diffusion model in achieving lower zero-shot Fréchet Inception Distances (FID). This comparison involves 30k COCO2014 caption-prompted images against the COCO2014 validation set, though it does so at the cost of a reduced CLIP score.

The one-step generators distilled with SiD-LSG achieve the following FID and CLIP scores:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="6">Stable Diffusion 1.5</th>
    <th>Guidance Scale</th>
    <th>FID</th>

## Installation

To install the necessary packages and set up the environment, follow these steps:

### Prepare the Code and Conda Environment

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-SLG.git
cd SiD-LSG
```
To create the Conda environment with all the required dependencies and activate it, run:

```bash
conda env create -f sid_lsg_environment.yml
conda activate sid_lsg
```




### Prepare the Datasets

To train the model, you need to provide training prompts. By default, we use **Aesthetic6+**, but you can also choose **Aesthetic6.25+**, **Aesthetic6.5+**, or any other list of prompts, as long as they do not include COCO captions. 

To obtain the **Aesthetic6+** prompts from Hugging Face, follow their guidelines. Once you have the prompts, save them in the following path:  
`/data/datasets/aesthetics_6_plus/aesthetics_6_plus.txt`.

Alternatively, you can download the prompts directly from [this link](https://huggingface.co/UT-Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/) and extract the `.tar` file to the specified directory.

To evaluate the zero-shot FID of the distilled one-step generator, you will first need to download the COCO2014 validation set from [COCOdataset](https://cocodataset.org/#download), and then prepare the COCO2014 validation set using the following command:
```
python cocodataset_tool.py --source=/path/to/COCO/val \
      --dest=MS-COCO-256/val --resolution=256×256
```

Once prepared, place them into the `/data/datasets/MS-COCO-256/val` folder.

To make an apple-to-apple comparison with previous methods such as [GigaGAN](https://mingukkang.github.io/GigaGAN/), you may use the `captions.txt`, obtained from [GigaGAN/COCOevaluation](https://github.com/mingukkang/GigaGAN/blob/main/evaluation/scripts/evaluate_GigaGAN_t2i_coco256.sh), to generate 30k images and use them to compute the zero-shot COCO2014 FID. 


## Usage



### Training
After activating the environment, you can run the scripts or use the modules provided in the repository. Example:

```bash
sh run_sid.sh 'sid1.5'
```

Adjust the --batch-gpu parameter according to your GPU memory limitations. To save memory, such as fitting GPU with 24GB memomry, you may set `--ema 0` to turn off EMA and set `--fp16 1` to use mixed-precision training. 

### Checkpoints of SiD-LSG one-step generators 

The one-step generators produced by SiD-LSG are provided in [huggingface/UT-Austin-PML/SiD-LSG](https://huggingface.co/UT-Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/tree/main)

You can first download the SiD-LSG one-step generators and place them into `/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/` or a folder you choose. Alternatively, you can replace `/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/` with 'https://huggingface.co/UT-Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/resolve/main/'  to directly download the checkpoint from HuggingFace

### Generate example images


Generate examples images using user-provided prompts and random seeds:

 - Reproduce Figure 1:

```bash
python generate_onestep.py --outdir='image_experiment/example_images/figure1' --seeds='8,8,2,3,2,1,2,4,3,4' --batch=16 --network='/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/batch512_sd21_cfg4.54.54.5_t625_7168_v2.pkl' --repo_id='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base'  --text_prompts='prompts/fig1-captions.txt'  --custom_seed=1
```

 - Reproduce Figure 6 (the columns labeled SD1.5 and SD2.1), ensuring the seeds align with the positions of the prompts within the HPSV2 defined list of prompts:
```bash
python generate_onestep.py --outdir='image_experiment/example_images/figure6/sd1.5' --seeds='668,329,291,288,057,165' --batch=6 --network='/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/batch512_cfg4.54.54.5_t625_8380_v2.pkl' --text_prompts='prompts/fig6-captions.txt' --custom_seed=1
```

```bash
python generate_onestep.py --outdir='image_experiment/example_images/figure6/sd2.1base' --seeds='668,329,291,288,057,165' --batch=6 --network='/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/batch512_sd21_cfg4.54.54.5_t625_7168_v2.pkl' --repo_id='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base'  --text_prompts='prompts/fig6-captions.txt' --custom_seed=1
```

 - Reproduce Figure 8:
```bash    
python generate_onestep.py --outdir='image_experiment/example_images/figure8' --seeds='4,4,1,1,4,4,1,1,2,7,7,6,1,20,41,48' --batch=16 --network='/data/Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/batch512_sd21_cfg4.54.54.5_t625_7168_v2.pkl' --repo_id='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base'  --text_prompts='prompts/fig8-captions.txt' --custom_seed=1
```

### Evaluations


- Generation: Generate 30K images to calculate zeroshot COCO FID (see the comments inside  [generate_onestep.py]([https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG/generate_onestep.py](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG/blob/main/generate_onestep.py)) for more detail):

```bash
#SLG guidance scale kappa1=kappa2=kappa3=kappa4 = 1.5, longer training
#FID 8.15, CLIP 0.304     
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 generate_onestep.py --outdir='image_experiment/sid_sd15_runs/sd1.5_kappa1.5_traininglonger/fake_images' --seeds=0-29999 --batch=16 --network='https://huggingface.co/UT-Austin-PML/SiD-LSG/resolve/main/batch512_cfg1.51.51.5_t625_18789_v2.pkl'  
```




- Computing evaluation metrics: Following GigaGAN to compute FID and CLIP using the 30k images generated with [generate_onestep.py](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG/blob/main/generate_onestep.py); you also need to place `captions.txt` into  the user defined path for `fake_dir`

Download [GigaGAN/evaluation](https://github.com/mingukkang/GigaGAN/tree/main/evaluation) 

Place `evaluate_SiD_t2i_coco256.sh` into its folder: `GigaGAN/evaluation/scripts`

Modify `fake_dir=` inside `evaluate_SiD_t2i_coco256.sh` to point to the folder that consits of `captions.txt` and the `fake_images` folder with 30k fake images, and run:

```bash
bash scripts/evaluate_SiD_t2i_coco256.sh
```
